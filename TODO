- Issues with the duration of audio, and possibly with how the last_10_items thing works
- Add websocket ping, since the socket will be killed if inactive for more than a certain period of time (consequence of SO_KEEPALIVE I think)
- Add sets of websocket clients on each thread subscribed to a particular endpoint
- Have 2 different types of broadcast, full broadcast (audio + music info) and partial (just music info)
